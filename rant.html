            <p>Hey New Zealand,</p>
            <p>We need to have a conversation about cats and being a responsible cat owner.</p>
            <p>Pets are wonderful. They're a source of joy, cuddles, and warmth. However, they are also under your care.</p>
            <p>They risk being hit by cars or attacked by other animals. They pose a danger to wildlife and other pets. There are also those out there who would steal your cat, rather than purchase their own pet.</p>
            <p>It should not be your neighbour's responsibility to protect their own property due to your negligence</p>
            <p>Practice good pet ownership and keep your cat healthy and safe by containing it to your property and home.</p>

            <p>Don't worry, the trap is checked multiple times a day, can be seen from the window, is place for protection from weather, and has food &amp; water.</p>
